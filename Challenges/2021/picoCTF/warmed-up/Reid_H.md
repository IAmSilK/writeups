To find the decimal equivalent of 0x3D, we must learn (through google or experience) that each hexadecimal digit represents a specific power of 16.

Then, we can find the flag by adding together 3\*16^1 and 13\*16^0, giving us an answer of 61. Note that in hexadecimal, D is equal to 13.

This means the flag is picoCTF{61}.
