To begin, the challenge description gives you a java file representing the source code of the security system. Our goal is to find the password/flag.

Upon opening the file we can see the following in the source code:

```java
 16     // The password is below. Is it safe to put the password in the source code?
 17     // What if somebody stole our source code? Then they would know what our
 18     // password is. Hmm... I will think of some ways to improve the security
 19     // on the other doors.
 20     //
 21     // -Minion #9567
 22     public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
 23         return password.equals("w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713");
 24     }
```

We can take the password from the code and input it in the format `picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713}` to complete the challenge.
