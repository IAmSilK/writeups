## Cusco

Reid figured out how to solve Cusco, you need to overflow the input buffer. 
If you provide 16 bytes (32 hex values), then the address of the door_unlock function, the door will be unlocked.
The trick is, you need to give the function address in little endian format. So, if the address is 4528, an input
string of `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA2845` will unlock the door (A being a random hex value)

What happens is, the program uses a specific address to store the function to execute. If we change that address, a 
different function will run. And if we give it the unlock_door function, the door will be unlocked. The trick was that
a sufficiently large input string will overwrite this address, so supplying an address in the input will work.

## Reykjavik

Started on this one, figured out that the program was putting an ASCII table into memory then modifying it programatically.
We did not figure out how to exploit it, however.
