## Cusco

Reid figured out how to solve Cusco, you need to overflow the input buffer. 
If you provide 16 bytes (32 hex values), then the address of the door_unlock function, the door will be unlocked.
The trick is, you need to give the function address in little endian format. So, if the address is 4528, an input
string of `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA2845` will unlock the door (A being a random hex value)
