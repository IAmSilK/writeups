To begin, we are given a PNG image revealing a set of numbers. Upon inspection of these numbers, we can see the format resembles that of picoCTF{xyz}.

Since we know the beginning of the flag is always 'picoCTF', we realize that each number corresponds to its respective position in the alphabet.

Using the above chart, we can convert '16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }' into 'PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}'
