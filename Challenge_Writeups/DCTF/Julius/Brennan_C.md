# Julius' ancient script

This one is just a text file with the flag in it: `rq7t{7vH_rFH_vI6_pHH1_qI67}`. 
The flag has clearly been put through a cipher.

Deciphering using a caesar (julius caesar) cipher gives `dc7f{7hT_dRT_hU6_bTT1_cU67}`

Deciphering using a special caesar cipher that uses numbers (https://planetcalc.com/8572/)
gives `dctf{th3_d13_h4s_b33n_c4st}`.
