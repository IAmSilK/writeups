# Don't Let It Run

PDF files can contain javascript that runs when the file is loaded. I copied the pdf into a text file
and opened it to see that there was indeed javascript listed. I replaced the 2114 characters with a's
(keeping the file the same size to be safe) then renamed the txt file as a pdf.

Instead of seeing a dragon, I was met with the image shown in `dragon_pic.png`.

I then tried turning the pdf into an editable document through Google drive (opened pdf with docs) and
was met with the file `dragon_doc.txt`. What it means, I have no idea.

I then exported the Google doc as a pdf for posterity (keeping colors/formatting) and put it into 
`dragon_doc_to_pdf.pdf`

This is where I stopped.
